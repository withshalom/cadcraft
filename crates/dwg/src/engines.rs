//! Two DWG engines, tried in order, around the acadrust bridge in this crate's root:
//!
//! 1. **WithShalom's open DWG and DXF crates** (`cad-dwg`, `cad-dxf`, MIT OR Apache-2.0,
//!    [`crate::cad_crates`]), tried first. They read DWG from R13 to 2018 and later except 2007
//!    (AC1021), write AutoCAD 2018 (AC1032) DWG, and count what a conversion leaves out. They use the
//!    standard library alone, so the web build reads and writes DWG with them too.
//! 2. **acadrust**, through this crate's own functions ([`crate::dwg_to_dxf_noted`],
//!    [`crate::dxf_to_dwg_as`]), unchanged, for whatever the open engine doesn't convert whole.
//!
//! So a conversion never loses what acadrust would have kept: the open engine's result is used
//! when it is complete, acadrust's otherwise, and the open engine's partial one (with notes on what
//! it left out) only when acadrust can't convert the file at all.
